	ptabtools 0.1
=====================
This package contains a utility to convert PowerTab files, as generated 
by the PowerTab editor, to GNU LilyPond files and a library that 
can be used by other programs.

Some of the fields in the ptab file format are still unknown to me, so the 
converter might crash on some file, perhaps with an assert error. Please send
me any ptb files that you find are crashing, and I will have a try at getting
them working.

Enjoy!
